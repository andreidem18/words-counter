There are five fragments included here. One is the most substantial section of the score, consisting of the whole of the first three scenes and part of the fourth.  These were only completed originally in piano short score, but were orchestrated for inclusion in this published version.

The second fragment is Bilbo’s walking song The road goes ever on. The material is also included in The Grey Havens as sung by Frodo at the end of the work, but this original use of the material is marginally different and has already been quoted during the interlude before the fourth scene.

The third fragment is the section depicting Gandalf’s reading of the words engraved on the One Ring. This draws upon material from The Silmarillion.

The fourth fragment consists of a single page which was originally intended for the opening of the third act.

The fifth fragment, the drinking song for Pippin and Merry, was originally published as one of the Seven Tolkien Songs and was orchestrated for this version.
